## About the Video Course
HTML5 (as a platform) is a collection of technologies, such as JavaScript and CSS3, that allows the delivery of new and exciting multimedia using the native features of new and more capable web browsers. It allows game developers to create fun, exciting, and immersive games, as well as other interactive content that can enhance your web portals.

HTML5 Game Development will teach you all that you need to know to get started with creating your first game in HTML5 so you can start building captivating games from scratch. 

This course is packed with step-by-step instructions to help you build modular code, optimize your game for deployment, and easily modify and reuse game logic to extend your game.

With this course, you’ll build two incrementally complex 2D games that run on both desktop and mobile browsers. This course will explain game programming best practices, complete with simplified game logic, physics and collision handling, as well as custom graphics and fonts. 

Your first exercise is a simple counting game that lays the foundations for creating clean, customizable, and modular code. We’ll then move on to building a “rush” game with moving backgrounds, basic physics, and dynamic scoreboards. 

We’ll cover essentials such as handling mobile touch events, controlling scene transitions, custom fonts and graphics, optimizing your game's load time, a loading progress bar, collision detection, keeping score, and creating a deployable game.

HTML5 Game Development will be your guide as you create two complete games that are compatible with multiple desktop and mobile web browsers.
